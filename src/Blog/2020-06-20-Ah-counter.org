- We could see that all members had very good performance in this meeting, and
  all of us made a big progress on the control of filler words.
- Amy always chooses the very interesting topics, and I think Amy really had a
  perfect performance in the first half of your speech. The usage of Uh, Um, Ur
  in your speech reduced a lot. At the second half maybe you became a little
  nervous, and you use some repeats. A little suggestion is that You could use
  pause instead of repeats when you are thinking.
- Rob, Leon and Linda are used to use some modal particles in their speech, and
  so am I. I know when we are searching the words in our head, we say Um and Ur
  subconsciously. I summarized three small suggestions for this situation. The
  first one is also using pause instead of Uh and Um. Second one is determining
  the purpose of the next sentence before you speak. The last on is stretching
  the words, that means you could speak slower and remain more time to think
  about the next sentence.
