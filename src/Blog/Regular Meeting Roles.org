Good evening Campus members and guests, my name is Cycoe. It is the
4th time for me to participate in Campus Meeting. I think you all know
my hometown, my hobbies and etc. So today, I will share the story
between Open Source and me.

The first Open Source software I contacted is GNU/Linux, and Ubuntu is
the first Linux distribution I have used. When I heard that my mobile
phone can flash Ubuntu, I began to search more information about this
system. After I read the introduction of the system, I thought Wow
it's cool, it's so different from Android and Windows. So I installed
it on my laptop without any troubles. True, installation was easy, but
use was so difficult. There was no Wechat, no QQ, no LOL, however I
wanted to play games! Worst of all, I didn't even know how to get
software. At that point, I felt helpless.

Luckily, I had a Firefox default installed. Now that I couldn't switch
back to Windows, I would search some guides for use, and had a try. At
that time, I used Baidu searching engine. But as you know, Baidu puts
many ads before the useful items, so that I had to pick out the useful
one in millions of items. Gradually I knew how to fetch software
packages from official and third-part repositories[rɪˈpɒzətri], and
how to use simple commands like `sed`, `awk` and `find`, to deal with
some simple tasks. Reading wiki and manuals is the most useful and
reliable way to figure out the functions and usages of software, but
reading manual is so painful.

With being skilled in installing Linux and software under Linux
platform, I read more and more articles like /The best Music Player
under Linux/, /Top 10 Linux Software/ and so on. I realized that there
are also many good-designed software under Linux, so I could do the
same thing under Linux as under Windows with the different software.
The best website to discover good software is GitHub, as known as the
largest programmer dating site in the world. Here, you can see what
the other programmers are coding, and what projects are in
trend[trend]. When I met problem, I would turn to GitHub for help.
Then I would find an almost out-of-box solution just needs several
configurations. That moment, I tasted the power of Open Source. All
your demands may have been realized by pioneers[ˌpaɪəˈnɪəz]. I use
FireFox to surf the Internet, use GIMP to modify my photos, use
Blender to build models, and use GPodder to listen to podcasts.

Open source doesn't just mean getting code for free, but also sharing,
cooperating and communicating with others. After the stage When I
downloaded others' source code and did some modifications, I began to
write my own tools. On the one hand I could satisfy my own needs, on
the other hand I could share it to others. Sharing always makes me
happy. In order to monitor the remain amount of lectures in our
educational administration system, I wrote a tool to notify me when
new lectures were released. Sometimes I was not satisfied with the
existing desktop environment, so I switched to the Open Source Dynamic
Window Manager, and did many enhancements on the source code to cater
to my taste, like adding a function to switch position of windows, or
change the default behavior of windows.

So, this is the story between Open Source and me, I feel lucky to hug
with Open Source, and share the story to you.

Thank you!

*** DONE 题目
光棍与购物狂欢
*** DONE 主旨与架构
1. 客观讲述双十一从光棍节到购物狂欢的转变，以及其代表的含义
2. 自己对于这种转变的认识
3. 分享与之相关的趣事

*** DONE 演讲稿
**** 开场：调动气氛
虽然一年一度的双十一刚刚过去，但是你们一定还对爆舱的快递印象深刻，一定
记得等待快递的那种焦急。可能你的上一个快递刚刚拿到手还没捂热，你就收到
了下一个快递的短信。那一刻，你望着长长的队伍，心想：快递小哥要是我男朋
友该多好。括弧，此条男生同样适用。

**** 讲述转变
众所周知，双十一是我国传统的光棍节，（咳），众所周知，双十一是我国传统
的购物狂欢节。在我还在上初中的时候，当时的校园里由于受到葬爱家族文化和
狂少家族文化的共同薰陶，同学们都开始流行过光棍节。一到每年的 11 月 11
号，就会有同学问我说：“你脱单了没？”那一刻，我感受到了灵魂的拷问，感
到无助且悲伤，甚至有些羞愧地低下了头。“脱单，脱单，说的轻松，我要是脱
了单现在你还能在这看见我？”好在马云爸爸弄了这么个购物狂欢节，让双十一
这天变得和谐了许多。现在一到双十一，别人都是问我，你下单了没？

**** 光棍节与购物狂欢节
不知道你们有没有想过，为什么双十一这天被定为了淘宝的购物狂欢节？有人可
能会说，是因为年底货卖不完了，商家想要通过这种方式把存货甩卖出去。也有
人可能会想，双十一双十一，情侣都出去过节了，马云爸爸是想给我们单身狗留
一片净土啊。脱单是不可能脱单的，只能逛逛淘宝，买买东西，勉强维持生活这
样子，不是很贴心吗？但现实总是残酷的，情侣们晚上出去吃完大餐，看完电影，
零点还要准时参加抢购大军。作为单身狗，双拳难敌别人四手你说气不气？看来
双十一不论是光棍节还是购物狂欢节，都对单身狗充满了恶意。所以这个世界，
还是需要给单身狗更多的温暖。

**** 脱单还是购物
一到每年的双十一这天，脱单和购物就成了我人生的两件头等大事。是“先脱单
还是先购物”就成了与“是先有鸡还是先有蛋”同等重要的哲学问题，时刻萦绕
在我的心头。为此，我还特意请教了相关有经验人士。

脱单派人士认为，脱单乃精神层面的提升，而购物只是物质层面的拥有。没有谈
过恋爱的男生只会去买那种“让女生感动到哭的 5 种礼物”，脱过单的男生能
够分得清枫叶红、豆沙红、番茄红、铁锈红，分得清霜、水、乳、粉底、眼影、
腮红、高光，脱过单的女生能够分得清红轴、茶轴、黑轴、青轴，薄膜、机械、
电容，买起东西来更是如有神助。

购物派人士则认为，一年那么多节日哪天不可以脱单？不说情人节、七夕节，甚
至连春节、元宵节、端午节、中秋节都被过成了情侣秀恩爱的节日。对象嘛随时
都可以找，双十一优惠一年一次错过可就是真错过咯。

那有没有能够脱单购物两不误的成功人士呢？当然有，比如说我。我的女朋友邱
大帅，是个勤俭持家的好姑娘。前几天双十一，她拿着刀大喊着要剁手，我赶紧
安慰她说：“亲爱的，钱没了可以再挣，手没了可就真没了，你放心买我掏
钱！”说到这，她才满意地把刀从我手上拿开。

**** 结尾：
从古至今，一年当中有太多的日子被我们赋予了各种各样的意义。双十一这天脱
不脱单其实不是那么重要，买不买东西其实也不重要，重要的是与你爱的人和爱
你的人共同度过。想到这，我关上了淘宝，踏上了回家的旅程。

#+LATEX:\lettrine[lines=2]{L}{ong}
long ago, there was a dark cave in the pitchwood forest, and the
kingdom of bats settled in the cave. One day, the old king of bat
died. So, bats had to voted for a new king. They decided to hold a
contest to choose the cruelest bat as thier new king.

Contest began, the first bat flew out and came back after 15 minutes.
"Do you see the cows on the grass?" The bat asked. All audiences
answered, "Yes!" "I have sucked up a crowd of cows." "Wow! You're
cruel /[\textprimstress kru\textlengthmark \textschwa l]/!"

Then it's the second bat's turn. The bat flew out and came back in 5
minutes with blood on his mouth. "Do you see the people in the
village?" The competitor asked. "Yes, I can!" All audiences said. "I
have sucked up a village of people." "Wow! You're so fierce
/[f\i\textschwa s]/!"

Then it turned to the last competitor. The last bat flew out and came
back just in 1 minute with the whole face covered by blood. "He must
be the new king!" All bats whispered to each other. "Can you see the
huge rock out of the cave?" "Yes, I can!" All bats were ready to
congratulate the new king. The new king said, "But I didn't."

several questions, easy or a little difficult. In this section, I will invite
some members to the stage and choose a question to deliver a improvised speech.
For each challenger, you will have 2 minutes totally to organize and express.
These figures don't stand for the content, and nor are arranged by difficulty.

Let's begin! So, who want to be the 1st.

*** DONE Introduce the functions of VPPR
CLOSED: [2019-12-27 Fri 12:06]
Good evening, club members and guests! I'm the candidate of VPPR, Cycoe. As you
know, VPPR denotes /Vice President Public Relations/, committed to introduce the
existence and benefits of the club to the local community and media. And spread
the influence through Internet, meanwhile, protect the club image.
*** DONE My advantages to take the role of VPPR
CLOSED: [2019-12-27 Fri 12:07]
These several sentences described the overall figure of the VPPR role. After
reading this description, I began to think about, what are my advantages to take
the VPPR role? Maybe, I benefit from my interest of design and my enthusiasm to
our club. In other words, I'm long for the skills of many design toolkits.
Wherever along the way, I have got some experience of photo editing, poster
designing and blackboard handwriting. Then I have enough enthusiasm to serve our
club with my skills. If there is a chance that I can take the role of VPPR, I
will try my best in the regular meeting, and convey the spirits to the
community.

Everything flows
*** DONE Draft
CLOSED: [2020-02-22 Sat 22:50]
The ancient Greek philosopher[哲学家] Heraclitus, the pioneer of Epistemology[认
识论], said that, Panta Rhei. It means everything flows. There is an equivalent
expression, No man ever steps in the same river twice, and the mountain you see
now is different from that you saw yesterday. It sounds a little trick that you
can say, the mountain is just in the different time-space. But I can tell you
that, in physical aspect, the mountain exactly changed. Today, I will introduce
you to rheology[流变学].

Rheology is an interesting subject, and it was founded in 1920s, while scholars
found that classical elasticity[弹性], plasticity[塑性] and fluid theory could
not describe the complicated properties of rubber, plastics and rocks. Earlier,
English physicists Maxwell and Kelvin had discovered the tight connection
between materials and time.

There are two typical patterns that materials perform when they are effected by
external forces. The first one is elasticity, like rubber bands. Rubber bands
will store the energy when you stretch it, and recover after forces offloading.
The second one is plasticity,like water.Water will transform the work into
internal energy. If you pour a basin of water on the ground,it will never
reshape into a basin again. All these things are obvious, but do you think about
whether it must be absolute.Answer is No. elastics can perform plasticity, and
plastics can also perform elasticity.It depends on the time scale in which you
obverse. With enough long time ,materials will mainly perform plasticity, and
with short time they will mainly perform elasticity. An excellent example ,
glass is a so-called super-cooling liquid[过冷液体] instead of a simple solid.
If you obverse the transformation of glass over a century-wide scale, you could
see the glass flows like the honey.

What does it mean? It means that it's almost meaningless to define the world
with a static snapshot. World performs different ways with different time scales
and spatial scales. Macrobian[长寿者] living over thousands of years go through
a different world from that short-life devils dying in an instant do. We are
human beings, we experience an unique world.

Good evening, Campus members and guests! I'm today's grammarian Cycoe! I will
introduce the keyword of today, render. Render is a verb that I have only seen
it in some books about computer technology, where it means "渲染". So I was
interested in the original meaning of it. The first meaning is to cause someone
or something to be in a particular state, like "His rudeness rendered me
speechless." The second meaning is to change words into a different language or
form, so it is a synonym of /translate/. She is rendering the book into English
from French. The third meaning is to give something such as a service, a
personal opinion or expression, or a performance of a song or poem, etc. to
people. In computer or graphics, it extends this meaning to "present". "MatLab
renders the graph of the PID control system" and "The graphics Processing Unit
renders the game images." So I wish you could use it as more as possible.

**** TTM - Laben
- Good Topic. Before this meeting, I thought maybe it is like the topic "phone
  addiction", finally, I found it's interesting topic
- good ppt design
- debug your ppt before meeting
**** Kobe
bilibili Kobe is really smart, that you extend this topic to his favorite app to
bilibili, and then describe his childhood about cartoons
**** Leon
If you are a foreigner in China, the most useful app is Baidu. Because Baidu is
a search engine. When Leon found that there was also some time, Leon also
introduced Wechat. I think if you could follow the thinking that a day of life
in China, It will be more logical, It's a personal suggestion.
**** Amy
- write my name, then write my reason, and you complain your reason why you
  followed this format with the situation that others add you, and you skip the
  second part of question.
**** Rob
I think Rob always have some different thoughts, the storage of your phone is
used out, you will clean some apps.
- you could introduce an app that you think is useful and an app that you think
  that can be replaced.
**** Nate
Nate extended the topic to If nessesary, which app would I uninstall. I think This
question is a little difficult for Nate.
- Question is a not that suitable, because it is not just about the favor, also
  something about copyright.
**** Rubby
Rubby is very logical that you separate this question into several parts, chat, work
- you could throw out your opinion first, the talk about the specific situations.
**** Julie
Julie is really like the people that is pure and innocent. Julie use an example
that her friend use a cute profile.

**** Opening speech and Introducing meeting roles - 3 min
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to this wonderful meeting! And also
welcome our guests! I wonder if you have watched the movie, /The Matrix/? The
background of our post for this meeting, is from this movie. The green letters
flowing down stand for the AI named /matrix/. These day, I reviewed these movies
and is shocked by the creativity of them. In 1999, 43 years after the first time
that Artificial Intelligence was introduced, people could make these fantastic
ideas. So today, let's fly our magical ideas, and have a good evening.

Back to the point, let's welcome our general evaluator Grace and her
professional evaluation team. Welcome, Grace!

**** Introduce Candymaster - 1 min
OK, thanks our evaluation team. This section is candy section, let's welcome our
Shirley and expect her interesting speech.

**** Introduce the 1st. speaker - 1 min
Thanks for our Shirley and her sharing. Next section is prepared speech section.
Let's welcome our first speaker, Jocelyn. Jocelyn, Th future world, the future
world, Jocelyn.

**** Thanks for the 1st. speaker - 1 min
Thanks for Jocelyn's speech, now we have 1min silence to write down the feels to
this speech. You can send the private message to Jocelyn directly.

**** 10 min Break
Now we have a 10 minute break. We will take a photo by screenshot.

**** Focus on the meeting - 1min
Everybody, Let's begin the second half. The next section is the most exciting
Table Topic Section. Let's welcome our Table Topic Master, Lucy. Welcome, Lucy!

**** Invite  TTs Evaluator to evaluate
Thanks for Lucy and her table topic section, next let's welcome our table topic
evaluator, Amy.

**** Vote & Count the results
OK, all our roles have finished their missions. Now, let's scan the qrcode that
I sent in our wechat group, and vote for your best speaker, best evaluator and
best function role.

**** When count the vote
Now, We need time to count the vote, who want to say something about our topic
or our speakers can speak offhand.

Yesterday in your Wechat group, Watson and I talked about the movie /The
Terminator/ and /The Matrix/. These two movie has something similar in their
conception. They all talked about the over-controlled AI controlled the world.
In Terminator is skynet and in Matrix is Matrix. They all mentioned the villains
[ˈvɪlən], in Terminator is terminator and in matrix is the agents. So they all
rang the alarm for us that AI may be over-controlled and the may control us. In
1997, IBM developed a AI named /Deep Blue/ that won the champion of cheese match.
These days, we almost cannot leave the AI. When you search the Internet, AI
gives you the most accurate answers. When you use digital map to navigate, AI
help you to find the shortest route. When you browse the Sina Blog, is also AI
pushing your favorite news to you. AI do many things for us, so we can really
expect the future world where AI will be more powerful.

**** Run off the meeting & Present Awards
Now is the most exciting section, we will present awards to our bests. Let's see
who is the best speaker. xxx, congratulations, xxx!

歡樂的時光過得特別快，又係時候講拜拜。

*** search about the meaning and usages
Good evening, Campus members and guests! I'm today's grammarian Cycoe! I will
introduce the keyword of today, explicit! explicit is an adjective, and it means
clear and exact. There are two common usages in our daily life. Someone is very
explicit about something means someone says something very clearly and exactly.
And make something explicit means state something clearly. The adverb of
explicit is explicitly. When you are using computer, explicit means you should
write down or do something exactly to let the computer know that you want
something different from the default options. I hope you could use this word as
more as possible in today's meeting. At some point after that, I will deliver a
report about your grammar performance. Thank you, back to our general evaluator.

**** Frame 1
Good evening guys, I am todays Candy Master Cycoe. Today my topic is when you
surf the Internet. When you surf the Internet, you may meet some words confusing
and maybe also interesting. So today I will intorduce some words that you may
meet someday to you.

**** Frame 2
When you surf the Internet, you must use a application named `browser` like
Chrome, Edge or Firefox. `browse` this word origianlly means the cows and goats
wander around and eat grass. So the word browser vividly describes the gesture
where you surf the Internet.

**** Frame 3
When you use the computer, you will always see these two words, cookie and
cache. 点心 和 快取
 
Cookie in computer stands for a small piece of data sent from a website and
stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is
browsing. Whether you notice it or not, almost websites just need login once,
and the second time it will login automatically. It is the authentication
cookies taking effect.

Cache is a technology or software component that stores data so that future
requests for that data can be served faster. So when you use computer, 360 and
金山毒霸 always popup a window to tell you that (清除缓存来加速电脑). Here 清除
缓存 just means clean the cache. Good using of cache could boost your computer,
sometimes clean the cache will even make your computer slower.

**** Frame 4
When you are register or logging-in, something will popup like these, all them
are called CAPTCHA, including 验证码, 滑块, 图像识别 and etc.

CAPTCHA is a contrived acronym of `completely automated public Turing test to
tell computers and humans apart`, just as its name implies, it is designed for
telling the difference between humans and computers, and refuses the actions
made by robots. CAPTCHAs are very important to our private security. Without
CAPTCHAs, hackers will access our passwords and personal information very
easily. But there are also some funny CAPTCHAs like these. I think neither
humans or robots could recognize it.

**** Frame 5
When you download a file from website, maybe the postfix of it is zip, 7z or
rar. we always call it an archive or a compressed package. Archive means you
sort the files (文件) and put theme into the correct drawer, and extract has the
opposite meaning that you take out a specific file from the archive. Compress
means you decrease the size of a file by some approaches, and decompress has the
opposite effect.

Nowadays we always mix using these two words, but in history, they have totally
difference meaning. In history, there were no large capacity storages, so
operator would backup data in the magnetic tapes like these. And then sorted the
tapes on the bookshelves. This action is called `tape archive`, so in some
modern system, the action that you put some files, images or videos into one
file is called `archive`. And the action that you decrease the size of archive
with some tools is called compress.

**** Frame 6
Imagine your firefox browser was crashed and can never open again, so you
described this problem in a forum. A guy asked you that you use a vanilla
version or a customized version. What was he talking about? Actually, vanilla is
a kind of flavoring and flower, and can be used to extract vanillin (香兰素).
But in computer softwares, and sometimes also other computing-related systems,
vanilla stands for those softwares that are not customized from their original
form, meaning that they are used without any customizations or updates applied
to them. So if he told you to use a vanilla version means that he told you to
clean your personal modifications and have a new installation. Maybe this way
can solve your problem.

*** Advantages
- It's term of graduation, so I think your really chose a good topic and content
  for this occasion. And after this vocation, you will graduate from BUCT, and
  may not have chance to take part in us again. I think it's reluctant to say
  goodbye with you, and it's a sad thing.
- I have to say I really like your pronunciation, and you also make progress
  from the first time you delivered a speech.
- I am very happy to see your progress in your speech speed control. In my
  memory, you usually speak too fast for me to catch up with you, and same the
  last meeting. But this speech, I think you have a good control with your speed.
*** Need to improve
- For content, I found that you expressed your topic by many imaginations, I
  think if you could give more examples about the experience will be better
- Another little suggestion is that when you have a speech online, you could sit
  back a little and exposing the upper part of the body, also exposing your arms
  and hands will better. And then we could capture more gestures.

Good evening, club members and guests! I'm your VPPR, Cycoe. Today, I will give
my work report of VPPR during the term of service.

Firstly, let me introduce the tasks and duties of VPPR. As you know, VPPR
denotes /Vice President Public Relations/, committed to introduce the existence
and benefits of the club to the local community and media. I think this is the
minimum requirement in VPPRs' responsibilities, let others know the existence of
our club and be willing to take part in. The higher requirement is that spread
the influence through Internet, meanwhile, protect the club image, which can
make the club better.

During my term of service, I made 17 posters for our regular meetings and also
the anniversary activity. (Press) Before the regular meetings, I sent the
posters and invitations into the guest wechat groups. (Press) After doing those,
I harvested a good rating on the design of poster. Before made each poster, I
had discussed the purpose of the topic with members to convey the topic meaning
accurately. After I sent the invitations in the guest wechat group, we attracted
some new guests into the meetings.

So, with this experience, I gained many things. Before I took the role of VPPR,
I was utterly ignorant of design. But now, I gained many skills in poster
design. As an official, I also built up connections with other clubs. But there
are also some pities. When I campaigned for this role, I said that I wanted to
establish our own website, but it haven't come true.

With this experience I think, maybe there are some pities, I also gained many
