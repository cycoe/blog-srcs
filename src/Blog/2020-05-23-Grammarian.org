** search about the meaning and usages
Good evening, Campus members and guests! I'm today's grammarian Cycoe! I will
introduce the keyword of today, explicit! explicit is an adjective, and it means
clear and exact. There are two common usages in our daily life. Someone is very
explicit about something means someone says something very clearly and exactly.
And make something explicit means state something clearly. The adverb of
explicit is explicitly. When you are using computer, explicit means you should
write down or do something exactly to let the computer know that you want
something different from the default options. I hope you could use this word as
more as possible in today's meeting. At some point after that, I will deliver a
report about your grammar performance. Thank you, back to our general evaluator.
